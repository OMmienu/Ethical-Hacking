# Challenge 3: Exploit Open SMB Server Shares

## Objective
The objective of this challenge is to identify **unsecured SMB (Server Message Block) shares** within the `10.5.5.0/24` network, enumerate shares accessible without authentication, and retrieve the Challenge 3 flag file.

---

## Network Scope
- Network Range: `10.5.5.0/24`
- Target Service: SMB (Ports 139, 445)

---

## Step 1: SMB Service Discovery

### Network Scanning
A network scan was conducted to identify hosts running SMB services:

```bash
nmap 10.5.5.0/24

The scan revealed a host with SMB-related ports open.

Identified SMB Host: 10.5.5.14

Open Ports: 139, 445

These ports indicate the presence of SMB services

SMB Share Enumeration
Enumerating Available Shares

SMB shares on the target host were enumerated using enum4linux:

enum4linux -S 10.5.5.14

Identifying Anonymous Access

To determine which shares were accessible without valid credentials, smbmap was used:

smbmap -H 10.5.5.14

Discovered Shares

homes

workfiles

IPC$

Shares Accessible Without Authentication

IPC$

Flag Discovery and Retrieval

Connected to the SMB server using an SMB client.

Navigated through accessible shares.

Located and downloaded the file containing the Challenge 3 flag.

Flag Details

Share containing the file: print$

Flag filename: sxij42.txt

Challenge 3 flag code: NWs39691

Successful retrieval confirms exploitation of unsecured SMB shares.

Key Findings

SMB services were exposed to the internal network.

Anonymous access was enabled on multiple shares.

Sensitive files were accessible without authentication.

Lack of access controls increased risk of data exposure.

Remediation Recommendations
1. Restrict SMB Network Access

Limit SMB exposure to trusted hosts and networks using firewalls, VLAN segmentation, and by disabling SMB on public-facing or unnecessary interfaces.

2. Harden SMB Authentication and Permissions

Disable anonymous access, enforce strong authentication, and apply the principle of least privilege to shared resources. Restrict share permissions to only authorized users
