# Final Capstone: Penetration Testing & Capture the Flag (CTF)

## Overview
This capstone project demonstrates a **full penetration testing engagement** conducted in a controlled lab environment. The assessment follows a structured ethical hacking methodology, beginning with reconnaissance and vulnerability discovery, progressing through exploitation, and concluding with remediation recommendations.

The engagement is implemented as a **Capture the Flag (CTF)** exercise. Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities results in the discovery of files containing **flag values**, which serve as proof of compromise.

All activities were performed strictly for educational purposes.

## Objectives
- Apply ethical hacking techniques to real-world style scenarios
- Identify and exploit web, network, and service-level vulnerabilities
- Capture and document flag files as evidence of exploitation
- Recommend remediation strategies to mitigate identified risks

---

## Methodology
The penetration test followed these standard phases:

1. Reconnaissance and Enumeration  
2. Vulnerability Analysis  
3. Exploitation  
4. Post-Exploitation and Flag Capture  
5. Remediation and Reporting  

A trial-and-error approach was often required, reflecting realistic penetration testing conditions and reinforcing problem-solving skills.

## Challenges Completed
- SQL Injection exploitation
- Web server vulnerability analysis
- Samba (SMB) share exploitation
- Network traffic analysis using Wireshark

---

## Ethical Disclaimer
This project was conducted **only in a simulated environment** with explicit authorization. Unauthorized penetration testing is illegal and unethical.
